## extending Tachyons

#### Breakpoints
If/when a new breakpoint is needed, just create it in it's own .css file. This way Tachyons can be freely updated and extentions will be separate.

#### Variables
`tachyons-for-styled-components` requires all variables to be in `:root` so you can just change them there.
